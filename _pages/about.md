Iâ€™m a Ph.D. student at the Department of Computer Sciences and Technology, Tongji University. My advisor is Prof. [Kai Yang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=irQuUaYAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=sra). My research interests include distributed optimization, nested optimization, and machine learning. I received the B.S. degree from Central South University, Changsha, China, in 2020. I was a visiting Ph.D. at CUHK Shenzhen in 2023 and my co-advisor is Prof. [Jianwei Huang](https://jianwei.cuhk.edu.cn/).
